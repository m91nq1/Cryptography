# Cryptography
This is a simple crypography code, this is my first project that got me into cryptography

 This is code encrypts a message, you copy the message using the keyboard shortcut and be selecting the decrypt option and pasting the cryptic message which will give you your initial message. To end the loop select the exit option.
